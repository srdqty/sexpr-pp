* Add a pre-processor in addition to a repl.
  The pre-processor reads in syntax and outputs raw s-expressions with
  the identifiers renamed.
  
  Input to the pre-processor should be: 
    * A stop set of identifiers for the core forms of the pre-processed s-expressions.
    * Definitions of macros for each identifier in the stop set so that
      core forms can be expanded as well.
